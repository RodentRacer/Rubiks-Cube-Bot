# Rubiks-Cube-Bot
A bot that simulates a Rubik's Cube.

To use this bot, add it to a folder of your choice from which you will run your bot and insert your token.
(Note: you need to install node.js and discord.js into this folder as well.)
To initialize the Rubik's Cube, I have the command as ",start", but you can change it to whatever you want.
Upon initilization, the bot will send a message with an unfolded image of a Rubik's cube, and react with your options for controlling it.

U - rotate the Up layer clockwise.

D - rotate the Down layer clockwise.

L - rotate the Left layer clockwise.

R - rotate the Right layer clockwise.

F - rotate the Front layer clockwise.

B - rotate the Back layer clockwise.

‚ÜîÔ∏è - rotate the Horizontal layer to the left.

‚ÜïÔ∏è - rotate the Vertical layer upwards.

üîÅ - rotate the Central layer clockwise.

If you send ",start" again, it will create a new instance of the cube and ignore the old one.
The bot should be able to remember all information through a crash/redeploy.

There is no command to solve the cube or to scramble it, and there's no special message when solving it.  It's exactly like a normal Rubik's Cube; you scramble it yourself, you solve it yourself, and solving it is it's own reward. :)

Have fun!
